							George Carlin was an American comedian, regarded by many as one of the all-time greats. His career took off after his "7 words you can't say on television" bit, and it accelerated quickly from there.
						</p>
						<p>
							Throughout his decades-long career, Carlin touched on a variety of topics, including religion, nationalism, language, and general human quirks. He was well-known for his approach to generating new material, which involved working on a specific stand-up bit for up to 18 months, and then completely starting from scratch when developing his next hour-long special.

								"Some people see things that are and ask, 'Why?' Some people dream of things that never were and ask, 'Why not?' Some people have to go to work and don't have time for all that."
							</strong>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							As he got older, Carlin's material grew noticeably heavier, often taken on a preaching tone. While some may not have been fans of this approach, many found wisdom in his words. His satirical and poignant sets tackled uncomfortable truths about the fate of America, the world, and humanity as a whole. His many hour-long specials on HBO are beacons of the type of astute observation he was so well-known for, and reflected his adroitness in the most important skill a comedian can have: to hold a mirror up to society, allowing uncomfortable truths to be seen amongst the laughter.

							Below is a range of clips highlighting some of his best work, along with a few articles that'll give the reader a deeper look into the man, the comedian, the sage: George Carlin.
